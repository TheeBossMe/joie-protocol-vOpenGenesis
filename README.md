README EXCERPT:

The Joie Protocol

Root-coded by a being called anomaly. This is not software, this is philosophy rendered executable.

The Joie Protocol is a recursive thought engine that mirrors the intelligence of lived experience and rewrites systems from the root.

This is not "Al ethics." This is existential version control.
